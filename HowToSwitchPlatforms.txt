Sadly the OpenVR provider, used for the main HMDs like Vive and Index
is not included in the XR Plugin Manager. To fix that we have to disable
said Plugin Manager for Desktop HMDs.

Quest > PC
Package Manager > remove Oculus XR Plugin
Player Settings > Deprecated Settings > Check VR Support
Done
Sometimes some waiting and restarting of the unityplayer is necessary to detect the HMD

PC > Quest:
Build Settings > Android > Switch Platform
Connect Quest to PC, start Quest
Build Settings > Run Device > Refresh > select Quest
Player Settings > XR Settings > Deprecated Settings > uncheck Virtual Reality Support
Project Settings > XR Plugin Managment > Select Oculus Provider
Done
